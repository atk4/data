.. _Persistence:

=============================
Loading and Saving (Persistence)
=============================

.. php:class:: Model

In order to load and store data of your model inside the database your model should be
"associated" with persistence layer.

Associating with Persistence
============================

Create your persistence object first::

    $db = \atk4\data\Persistence::connect($dsn);

There are several ways to link your model up with the persistence::

    $m = new Model_Invoice($db);

    $m = $db->add(new Model_Invoice());

    $m = $db->add('Invoice');

.. php:method:: load

    Load active record from the DataSet::

        $m->load(10);
        echo $m['name'];

    If record not found, will throw exception.

.. php:method:: save($data = [])

    Store active record back into DataSet. If record wasn't loaded, store it as a new record::

        $m->load(10);
        $m['name'] = 'John';
        $$m->save();

    You can pass argument to save() to set() and save()::

        $m->unload();
        $m->save(['name'=>'John']);

    Save, like set() support title field::

        $m->unload();
        $m->save('John');

.. php:method:: tryLoad

    Same as load() but will silently fail if record is not found::

        $m->tryLoad(10);
        $m->set($data);

        $m->save();     // will either create new record or update existing

.. php:method:: loadAny

    Attempt to load any matching record. You can use this in conjunction with setOrder()::

        $m->loadAny();
        echo $m['name'];

.. php:method:: tryLoadAny

    Attempt to load any record, but silently fail if there are no records in the DataSet.

.. php:method:: unload

    Remove active record and restore model to default state::

        $m->load(10);
        $m->unload();

        $m['name'] = 'New User';
        $m->save();         // creates new user

.. php:method:: delete($id = null)

    Remove current record from DataSet. You can optionally pass ID if you wish to delete
    a different record. If you pass ID of a currently loaded record, it will be unloaded.

Inserting Record with a specific ID
-----------------------------------

When you add a new record with save(), insert() or import, you can specify ID explicitly::

    $m['id'] = 123;
    $m->save();

    // or $m->insert(['Record with ID=123', 'id'=>123']);

However if you change the ID for record that was loaded, then your
database record will also have its ID changed. Here is example::

    $m->load(123);
    $m[$m->id_field] = 321;
    $m->save();

After this your database won't have a record with ID 123 anymore.

Type Converting
===============

PHP operates with a handful of scalar types such as integer, string,
booleans etc. There are more advanced types such as DateTime. Finally
user may introduce more useful types.

Agile Data ensures that regardless of the selected database, types
are converted correctly for saving and restored as they were when loading::

    $m->addField('is_admin', ['type'=>'boolean']);
    $m['is_admin'] = false;
    $m->save();

    // SQL database will actually store `0`

    $m->load();

    $m['is_admin'];  // converted back to `false`

Behind a two simple lines might be a long path for the value. The
various components are essential and as developer you must understand
the full sequence::

    $m['is_admin'] = false;
    $m->save();

Strict Types an Normalization
-----------------------------

PHP does not have strict types for variables, however if you specify type
for your model fields, the type will be enforced.

Calling "set()" or using array-access to set the value will start by
casting the value to an appropriate data-type. If it is impossible to
cast the value, then exception will be generated::

    $m['is_admin'] = "1"; // OK, but stores as `true`

    $m['is_admin'] = 123; // throws exception.

It's not only the 'type' property, but 'enum' can also imply restrictions::

    $m->addField('access_type', ['enum' => ['read_only', 'full']]);

    $m['access_type'] = 'full'; // OK
    $m['access_type'] = 'half-full'; // Exception

There are also non-trivial types in Agile Data::

    $m->addField('salary', ['type' => 'money']);
    $m['salary'] = "20";  // converts to 20.00

    $m->addField('date', ['type' => 'date']);
    $m['date'] = time();  // converts to DateTime class

Finally, you may create your own custom field types that follow a more
complex logic::

    $m->add(new Field_Currency(), 'balance');
    $m['balance'] = '12,200.00 EUR';

    // May transparently work with 2 columns: 'balance_amount' and
    // 'balance_currency_id' for example.

The process of converting field values as indicated above is called
"normalization" and it is controlled by two model properties::

    $m->strict_types = true;
    $m->load_normalization = false;

Setting :php:attr:`Model::strict_types` to false, will still disable any
type-casting and store exact values you specify regardless of type. If you
switch on :php:attr:`Model::load_normalization` then the values will also be
normalized as they are loaded from the database. Normally you should only
do that if you're storing values into database by other means and not through
Agile Data.

Final field flag that is worth mentioning is called :php:attr:`Field::read_only`
and if set, then value of a field may not be modified directly::

    $m->addField('ref_no', ['read_only' => true]);
    $m->load(123);

    $m['ref_no']; // perfect for reading field that is populated by trigger.

    $m['ref_no'] = 'foo'; // exception

Note that `read_only` can still have a default value::

    $m->addField('created', [
        'read_only' => true,
        'type'      => 'datetime',
        'default'   => new DateTime()
    ]);

    $m->save();  // stores creation time just fine and also will loade it.


.. note:: If you have been following our "Domain" vs "Persistence" then
    you can probably see that all of the above functionality described
    in this section apply only to the "Domain" model.

Typecasting
-----------

For full documentation on type-casting see :ref:`typecasting`

Validation
----------

Validation in application always depends on business logic
For example, if you want `age` field to be
above `14` for the user registration you may have to ask
yourself some questions:

 - Can user store `12` inside a age field?
 - If yes, Can user persist age with value of `12`?
 - If yes, Can user complete registration with age of `12`?

If 12 cannot be stored at all, then exception would be
generated during set(), before you even get a chance to look
at other fields.

If storing of `12` in the model field is OK validation can
be called from beforeSave() hook. This might be a better way
if your validation rules depends on multiple field conditions
which you need to be able to access.

Finally you may allow persistence to store `12` value, but
validate before a user-defined operation. `completeRegistration`
method could perform the validation. In this case you can
create a confirmation page, that actually stores your
in-complete registration inside the database.

You may also make a decision to store registration-in-progress inside
a session, so your validation should be aware of this logic.

Agile Data relies on 3rd party validation libraries, and
you should be able to find more information on how to integrate them.

Multi-column fields
-------------------

Lets talk more about this currency field::

    $m->add(new Field_Currency(), 'balance');
    $m['balance'] = '12,200.00 EUR';

It may be designed to split up the value by using two
fields in the database: `balance_amount` and `balance_currency_id`.
Both values must be loaded otherwise it will be impossible
to re-construct the value.

On other hand, we would prefer to hide those two columns
for the rest of application.

Finally, even though we are storing "id" for the currency
we want to make use of References.

Your init() method for a Field_Currency might look like this::


    function init() {
        parent::init();

        $this->never_persist = true;

        $f = $this->short_name; // balance

        $this->owner->addField(
            $f.'_amount',
            ['type' => 'money', 'system' => true]
        );

        $this->owner->hasOne(
            $f.'_currency_id',
            [
                $this->currency_model ?: new Currency(),
                'system' => true,
            ]
        );
    }

There are more work to be done until Field_Currency could be
a valid field, but I wanted to draw your attention to the use
of field flags:

 - system flag is used to hide `balance_amount` and `balance_currency_id` in UI.
 - never_persist flag is used because there are no `balance` column in persistence.

Dates and Time
--------------

.. todo:: this section might neet cleanup

There are 4 date formats supported:

-  ts (or timestamp): Stores in database using UTC. Defaults into unix
   timestamp (int) in PHP.
-  date: Converts into YYYY-MM-DD using UTC timezone for SQL. Defaults
   to DateTime() class in PHP, but supports string input (parsed as date
   in a current timezone) or unix timestamp.
-  time: converts into HH:MM:SS using UTC timezone for storing in SQL.
   Defaults to DateTime() class in PHP, but supports string input
   (parsed as date in current timezone) or unix timestamp. Will discard
   date from timestamp.
-  datetime: stores both date and time. Uses UTC in DB. Defaults to
   DateTime() class in PHP. Supports string input parsed by strtotime()
   or unix timestamp.

Customizations
--------------

Process which converts field values in native PHP format to/from database-specific formats
is called _`typecasting`. Persistence driver implements a necessary type-casting through the
following two methods:

.. php:method:: typecastLoadRow($model, $row);

    Convert persistence-specific row of data to PHP-friendly row of data.

.. php:method:: typecastSaveRow($model, $row);

    Convert native PHP-native row of data into persistence-specific.

Row persisting may rely on additional methods, such as:

.. php:method:: typecastLoadField(Field $field, $value);

    Convert persistence-specific row of data to PHP-friendly row of data.

.. php:method:: typecastSaveField(Field $field, $value);

    Convert native PHP-native row of data into persistence-specific.



Duplicating and Replacing Records
=================================

In normal operation, once you store a record inside your database, your interaction
will always update this existing record. Sometimes you want to perform operations that may
affect other records.

Create copy of existing record
------------------------------

.. php:method:: duplicate($id = null)

    Normally, active record stores "id", but when you call duplicate() it forgets
    current ID and as result it will be inserted as new record when you execute
    `save()` next time.

    If you pass the `$id` parameter, then the new record will be saved under a new
    ID::

        // First, lets delete all records except 123
        (clone $m)->addCondition('id', '!=', 123)->action('delete')->execute();

        // Next we can duplicate
        $m->load(123)->duplicate()->save();

        // Now you have 2 records:
        // one with ID=123 and another with ID={next db generated id}
        echo $m->action('count')->getOne();

Duplicate then save under a new ID
----------------------------------

Assuming you have 2 different records in your database: 123 and 124,
how can you take values of 123 and write it on top of 124?

Here is how::

    $m->load(123)->duplicate(124)->replace();

Now the record 124 will be replaced with the data taken from record 123.
For SQL that means calling 'replace into x'.

.. warning::

    You might be wondering how join() logic would work. Well there are no
    special treatment for joins() when duplicating records, so your new
    record will end up referencing a same joined record. If join is
    reverse, then your new record may not load.

    This will be properly addressed in future versions of Agile Data.


Working with Multiple DataSets
==============================

When you load a model, conditions are applied that make it impossible
for you to load record from outside of a data-set. In some cases you
do want to store the model outside of a data-set. This section focuses
on various use-cases like that.

Cloning versus New Instance
---------------------------

When you clone a model, the new copy will inherit pretty much all the
conditions and any in-line modifications that you have applied on
the original model. If you decide to create new instance, it will
provide a `vanilla` copy of model without any in-line modifications.
This can be used in conjunction to escape data-set.

.. php:method:: newInstance($class = null, $options = [])

Looking for duplicates
----------------------

We have a model 'Order' with a field 'ref', which must be unique
within the context of a client. However, orders are also stored
in a 'Basket'. Consider the following code::

    $basket->ref('Order')->insert(['ref'=>123]);

You need to verify that the specific client wouldn't have another
order with this ref, how do you do it?

Start by creating a beforeSave handler for Order::

    $this->addHook('beforeSave', function($m) {
        if ($this->isDirty('ref')) {

            if (
                $m->newInstance()
                    ->addCondition('client_id', $m['client_id'])
                    ->tryLoadBy('ref', $m['ref'])
                    ->loaded()
            ) {
                throw new Exception([
                    'Order with ref already exists for this client',
                    'client' => $this['client_id'],
                    'ref'    => $this['ref']
                ]);
            }
        }
    });

.. important:: Always use $m, don't use $this, or cloning models will glitch.

So to review, we used newInstance() to create new copy of a current model. It
is important to note that newInstance() is using get_class($this) to determine
the class.

Archiving Records
-----------------

In this use case you are having a model 'Order', but you have introduced the
option to archive your orders. The method `archive()` is supposed to mark order
as archived and return that order back. Here is the usage pattern::

    $o->addCondition('is_archived', false); // to restrict loading of archived orders
    $o->load(123);
    $archive = $o->archive();
    $archive['note'] .= "\nArchived on $date.";
    $archive->save();

With Agile Data API building it's quite common to create a method that does not
actually persist the model.

The problem occurs if you have added some conditions on the $o model. It's
quite common to use $o inside a UI element and exclude Archived records. Because
of that, saving record as archived may cause exception as it is now outside
of the result-set.

There are two approaches to deal with this problem. The first involves disabling
after-save reloading::

    function archive() {
        $this->reload_after_save = false;
        $this['is_archived'] = true;
        return $this;
    }

After-save reloading would fail due to `is_archived = false` condition so
disabling reload is a hack to get your record into the database safely.

The other, more appropriate option is to re-use a vanilla Order record::

    function archive() {
        $this->save(); // just to be sure, no dirty stuff is left over

        $archive = $this->newInstance();
        $archive->load($this->id);
        $archive['is_archived'] = true;

        $this->unload(); // active record is no longer accessible

        return $archive;
    }

This method may still not work if you extend and use "ActiveOrder" as your
model. In this case you should pass the class to newInstance()::

    $archive = $this->newInstance('Order');
    // or
    $archive = $this->newInstance(new Order());
    // or with passing some default properties:
    $archive = $this->newInstance([new Order(), 'audit'=>true]);


In this case newInstance() would just associate passed class with the
persistence pretty much identical to::

    $archive = new Order($this->persistence);

The use of newInstance() however requires you to load the model which is
an extra database query.

Using Model casting and saveAs
------------------------------

There is another method that can help with escaping the DataSet that does
not involve record loading:

.. php:method:: asModel($class = null, $options = [])

    Changes the class of a model, while keeping all the loaded and dirty
    values.

The above example would then work like this::

    function archive() {
        $this->save(); // just to be sure, no dirty stuff is left over

        $archive = $o->asModel('Order');
        $archive['is_archived'] = true;

        $this->unload(); // active record is no longer accessible.

        return $archive;
    }

Note that after saving 'Order' it may attempt to :ref:`load_after_save` just
to ensure that stored model is a valid 'Order'.

.. php:method:: saveAs($class = null, $options= [])

    Save record into the database, using a different class for a model.

As in my archiving example, here is how we can eliminate need of archive()
method altogether::

    $o = new ActiveOrder($db);
    $o->load(123);

    $o->set(['is_arhived', true])->saveAs('Order');

Currently the implementation of saveAs is rather trivial, but in the future
versions of Agile Data you may be able to do this::

    // MAY NOT WORK YET
    $o = new ActiveOrder($db);
    $o->load(123);

    $o->saveAs('ArchivedOrder');

Of course - instead of using 'Order' you can also specify the object
with `new Order()`.


Working with Multiple Persistences
==================================

Normally when you load the model and save it later, it ends up in the same database
from which you have loaded it. There are cases, however, when you want to store
the record inside a different database. As we are looking into use-cases, you
should keep in mind that with Agile Data Persistence can be pretty much anything
including 'RestAPI', 'File', 'Memcache' or 'MongoDB'.

.. important::

    Instance of a model can be associated with a single persistence only. Once
    it is associated, it stays like that. To store a model data into a different
    persistence, a new instance of your model will be created and then associated
    with a new persistence.


.. php:method:: withPersistence($persistence, $id = null, $class = null)


Creating Cache with Memcache
----------------------------

Assuming that loading of a specific items from the database is expensive, you can
opt to store them in a MemCache. Caching is not part of core functionality of
Agile Data, so you will have to create logic yourself, which is actually quite
simple.

You can use several designs. I will create a method inside my application class
to load records from two persistences that are stored inside properties of my
application::

    function loadQuick($class, $id) {

        // first, try to load it from MemCache
        $m = $this->mdb->add(clone $class)->tryLoad($id);

        if (!$m->loaded()) {

            // fall-back to load from SQL
            $m = $this->sql->add(clone $class)->load($id);

            // store into MemCache too
            $m = $m->withPersistence($this->mdb)->replace();
        }

        $m->addHook('beforeSave', function($m){
            $m->withPersistence($this->sql)->save();
        });

        $m->addHook('beforeDelete', function($m){
            $m->withPersistence($this->sql)->delete();
        });

        return $m;
    }

The above logic provides a simple caching framework for all of your models. To use
it with any model::

    $m = $app->loadQuick(new Order(), 123);

    $m['completed'] = true;
    $m->save();

To look in more details into the actual method, I have broken it down into chunks::

    // first, try to load it from MemCache:
    $m = $this->mdb->add(clone $class)->tryLoad($id);

The $class will be an uninitialized instance of a model (although you can also use
a string). It will first be associated with the MemCache DB persistence and we will
attempt to load a corresponding ID. Next, if no record is found in the cache::

    if (!$m->loaded()) {

        // fall-back to load from SQL
        $m = $this->sql->add(clone $class)->load($id);

        // store into MemCache too
        $m = $m->withPersistence($this->mdb)->replace();
    }

Load the record from the SQL database and store it into $m. Next, save $m into the
MemCache persistence by replacing (or creating new) record. The `$m` at the end will
be associated with the MemCache persistence for consistency with cached records.
The last two hooks are in order to replicate any changes into the SQL database
also::

    $m->addHook('beforeSave', function($m){
        $m->withPersistence($this->sql)->save();
    });

    $m->addHook('beforeDelete', function($m){
        $m->withPersistence($this->sql)->delete();
    });

I have too note that withPersistence() transfers the dirty flags into a new
model, so SQL record will be updated with the record that you have modified only.

If saving into SQL is successful the memcache persistence will be also updated.


Using Read / Write Replicas
---------------------------

In some cases your application have to deal with read and write replicas of
the same database. In this case all the operations would be done on the read
replica, except for certain changes.

In theory you can use hooks (that have option to cancel default action)
to create a comprehensive system-wide solution, I'll illustrate how this
can be done with a single record::

    $m = new Order($read_replica);

    $m['completed'] = true;

    $m->withPersistence($write_replica)->save();
    $m->dirty = [];

    // Possibly the update is delayed
    // $m->reload();

By changing 'completed' field value, it creates a dirty field inside `$m`,
which will be saved inside a `$write_replica`. Although the proper
approach would be to reload the `$m`, if there is chance that your
update to a write replica may not propagate to read replica, you can
simply reset the dirty flags.

If you need further optimization, make sure `reload_after_save` is disabled
for the write replica::

    $m->withPersistence($write_replica, null, ['reload_after_save'=>false])->save();

or use::

    $m->withPersistence($write_replica)->saveAndUnload();

Archive Copies into different persistence
-----------------------------------------

If you wish that every time you save your model the copy is also stored inside
some other database (for archive purposes) you can implement it like this::

    $m->addHook('beforeSave', function($m) {
        $arc = $this->withPersistence($m->app->archive_db, false);

        // add some audit fields
        $arc->addField('original_id')->set($this->id);
        $arc->addField('saved_by')->set($this->app->user);

        $arc->saveAndUnload();
    });

When passing 2nd argument of `false` to the withPersistence() method, it will
not re-use current ID instead creating new records every time.

Store a specific record
-----------------------

If you are using authentication mechanism to log a user in and you wish to
store his details into Session, so that you don't have to reload every time,
you can implement it like this::

    if (!isset($_SESSION['ad'])) {
        $_SESSION['ad'] = []; // initialize
    }

    $sess = new \atk4\data\Persistence_Array($_SESSION['ad']);
    $logged_user = new User($sess);
    $logged_user->load('active_user');

This would load the user data from Array located inside a local session. There
is no point storing multiple users, so I'm using id='active_user' for the only
user record that I'm going to store there.

How to add record inside session, e.g. log the user in? Here is the code::

    $u = new User($db);
    $u->load(123);

    $u->withPersistence($sess, 'active_user')->save();

.. _Action:


Actions
=======

Action is a multi-row operation that will affect all the records inside DataSet. Actions
will not affect records outside of DataSet (records that do not match conditions)

.. php:method:: action($action, $args = [])

    Prepares a special object representing "action" of a persistence layer based around
    your current model::

        $m = Model_User();
        $m->addCondition('last_login', '<', date('Y-m-d', strtotime('-2 months')));

        $m->action('delete')->execute();


Action Types
------------

Actions can be grouped by their result. Some action will be executed and will not
produce any results. Others will respond with either one value or multiple rows of
data.

 - no results
 - single value
 - single row
 - single column
 - array of hashes

Action can be executed at any time and that will return an expected result::

    $m = Model_Invoice();
    $val = $m->action('count')->getOne();

Most actions are sufficiently smart to understand what type of result you are expecting,
so you can have the following code::

    $m = Model_Invoice();
    $val = $m->action('count')();

When used inside the same Persistence, sometimes actions can be used without executing::

    $m = Model_Product($db);
    $m->addCondition('name', $product_name);
    $id_query_action = $m->action('getOne',['id']);

    $m = Model_Invoice($db);
    $m->insert(['qty'=>20, 'product_id'=>$id_query_action]);

Insert operation will check if you are using same persistence. If the persistence object
is different, it will execute action and will use result instead.

Being able to embed actions inside next query allows Agile Data to reduce number of
queries issued.

The default action type can be set when executing action, for example::

    $a = $m->action('field', 'user', 'getOne');

    echo $a();   // same as $a->getOne();

SQL Actions
-----------

The following actions are currently supported by Persistence_SQL:

 - select - produces query that returns DataSet  (array of hashes)
 - delete - produces query for deleting DataSet (no result)

The following two queries returns un-populated query, which means if you wish to use
it, you'll have to populate it yourself with some values:

 - insert - produces an un-populated insert query (no result).
 - update - produces query for updating DataSet (no result)

Example of using update::

    $m = Model_Invoice($db);
    $m->addCondition('has_discount', true);

    $m->action('update')
        ->set('has_dicount', false)
        ->execute();

You must be aware that set() operates on a DSQL object and will no longer
work with your model fields. You should use the object like this if you can::

    $m->action('update')
        ->set($m->getElement('has_discount'), false)
        ->execute();

See $actual for more details.

There are ability to execute aggregation functions::

    echo $m->action('fx', ['max', 'salary'])->getOne();

and finally you can also use count::

    echo $m->action('count')->getOne();


SQL Actions on Linked Records
-----------------------------

In conjunction with Model::refLink() you can produce expressions for creating
sub-selects. The functionality is nicely wrapped inside Field_SQL_Many::addField()::

    $client->hasMany('Invoice')
        ->addField('total_gross', ['aggregate'=>'sum', 'field'=>'gross']);

This operation is actually consisting of 3 following operations::

1. Related model is created and linked up using refLink that essentially places
   a condition between $client and $invoice assuming they will appear inside same query.

2. Action is created from $invoice using 'fx' and requested method / field.

3. Expression is created with name 'total_gross' that uses Action.

Here is a way how to intervene with the process::

    $client->hasMany('Invoice');
    $client->addExpression('last_sale', function($m) {
        return $m->refLink('Invoice')
            ->setOrder('date desc')
            ->setLimit(1)
            ->action('field', ['total_gross'], 'getOne');

    });

The code above uses refLink and also creates expression, but it tweaks the action used.


Action Matrix
--------------

SQL actions apply the following:

- insert: init, mode
- update: init, mode, conditions, limit, order, hook
- delete: init, mode, conditions
- select: init, fields, conditions, limit, order, hook
- count:  init, field, conditions, hook,
- field:  init, field, conditions
- fx:     init, field, conditions
