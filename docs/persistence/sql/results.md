# Results

When query is executed by {php:class}`Connection` or
[PDO](https://php.net/manual/en/pdo.query.php), it will return an object that
can stream results back to you. The PDO class execution produces a
`Doctrine\DBAL\Result` object which you can iterate over.

If you are using a custom connection, you then will also need a custom object
for streaming results.

The only requirement for such an object is that it has to be a
[Generator](https://php.net/manual/en/language.generators.syntax.php).
In most cases developers will expect your generator to return sequence
of id => hash representing a key/value result set.
