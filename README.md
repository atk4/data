The main goals of Agile Data are to be:

 - Simple - to learn, to read/write code and to extend. Even for beginners.
 
 - Efficient - solves scalability challenges you face with traditional ORM.
 
 - Database Agnostic - your code will work with SQL, NoSQL vendors or JSON files with optimal efficiency.
 
 - Enterprise Quality - ideal solution for large teams and complex business projects with DM/PM separation.

 - Works Anywhere - uses composer and namespaces and can be used in any PHP project.
 
 - Agile Toolkit - part of a full-stack PHP Web UI Framework for building your web apps.

 - Aggregate Models - build reports and analytics using Domain Models logic (not custom queries).

 - Extensible - add new vendor drivers to take full advantage of their query languages and capabilities.

 - Full Featured - support for SQL joins, sub-selects, expressions, multi-row updates, hooks, caching, REST proxies, validation, data-type normalization, debugging, profiling, migrators and schema generators.
 

## Agile Data in Practice

To achieve its goals Agile Data introduces two new concepts into Database Abstraction of your applications:

 - DataSet - Represents a scope of records located in one or several tables/collections in your database that can be addressed by a Business Model.
 
 - Action - Certain operation that will affect all records in a DataSet when executed.

### Real-life usage example
 
**Requirement: Calculate total outstanding amount on all orders placed by VIP clients.** 

A task that would normally require you to write a stored SQL procedure, cache data or sacrifice performance can be solved elegantly in Agile Data using database-independent declarative logic:

(note: [click here to see declaration of model classes](https://github.com/atk4/data/wiki/README-Example-Support-Files))

```
  $clients = new Model_Client($db);
  // Object representing all clients - DataSet

  $clients -> addCondition('is_vip', true);
  // Now DataSet is limited to VIP clients only

  $vip_client_orders = $clients->refSet('Order');
  // This DataSet will contain only orders placed by VIP clients

  $vip_client_orders -> addExpression('item_current_price')-set(function($model, $query){
      return $model->ref('item_id')->fieldQuery('price');
  });
  // Defines a new field for a model expressed through relation with Item

  $vip_client_orders -> addExpression('payments_made')-set(function($model, $query){
      return $model->ref('Payment')->sum('amount_paid');
  });
  // Defines another field as sum of related payments
  
  $vip_client_orders -> addExpression('total_due')->set(function($model, $query){
      return $query->expr('{item_current_price} * {qty} - {payments_made}');
  });
  // Defines third field for calculating total_due

  $total_due_payment = $vip_client_orders->sum('total_due')->getOne();
  // Defines and executes "sum" action on our expression across specified data-set
```

Only the final `getOne()` will build and execute database query. Depending on which database vendor you use ($db), execution strategy will be different:

 - SQL: single standard SELECT (with some sub-queries) is executed. Single field/row is fetched.
 
 - Array $data: composes the function, then executes it with $data. (see [Phamda](https://github.com/mpajunen/phamda))
 
 - NoSQL: total of 3 or less queries (depending on database capabilities) will be executed and data from separate queries merged together in PHP giving you a total value.


## Busines Benefits of Agile Data

It makes a lot of sense to have business logic of your application refactored with Agile Data. You will gain the following advantages:


 - Improve your development team efficiency by 70% without sacrifice of your code performance.

 - Express all your business logic in "Domain Model" — your code does not rely on particular database vendor and you can switch from MySQL to MongoDB (or other vendor) with minimum effort.

 - Taking full advantage of your database — Agile Data executes actions server-side such as multi-row updates - when vendor supports it. Your application always uses most-efficient approach.
 
 - Full support for Unit Tests — Achieve 100% coverage of your business logic by mocking operations with test-$data expressed through array or JSON.
 
 - Cross-vendor model traversing — Different parts of your business logic may use different databases. Agile Data supports cross-vendor relations.
  
 - Significantly lower code complexity and total cost of ownership.
 
 - Full data consistency when you need to build aggregation reports (group by, union, join)

 - Reliable foundation - Agile Data is highly tested and super-stable.
 
 - UI extension - Build your Admin UI within hours with Agile Toolkit once you have Agile Data in place.
 
 - Commercial Support - Agile Data is developed and backed by London-based tech company.

### Downloading Agile Data

You can install Agile Data through composer:

```
composer require atk4/data
```


## Quality promise from Agile Toolkit

We also care about your experience while using our toolkit, so we will:

 - work with [developer community](https://gitter.im/atk4/dataset?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) and discuss main decisions collaboratively. 
 - write short and easy-to-read, standard-compliant code with high code-climate score.
 - unit-test our own code. Achieve a minimum of 95% code coverage for stable releases.
 - add code [through pull requests](https://github.com/atk4/data/pulls?utf8=✓&q=is%3Apr+) and discuss them before merging.
 - never break APIs in minor releases.
 - support composer, include minimum dependencies.
 - be friendly with all higher-level frameworks.

See [www.agiletoolkit.org](http://www.agiletoolkit.org/) for more frameworks and libraries that can make your PHP Web Application even more efficient.

 
## Mini-FAQ

### Q: Will Agile Data be here in 5 years time?

Yes.

The founder and lead developer for this library is: [Romans Malinovskis](https://www.openhub.net/accounts/romaninsh) who has been a long-time open-source developer and maintainer of Agile Toolkit (PHP UI Framemwork). Agile Data is developed as part of Agile Toolkit refactoring and will be bundled with Agile Toolkit 4.4.

### Q: Why not improve existing [ORM] project/framework X?

That's exactly what we are doing.

Agile Data is a refactor of "Model" implementation from Agile Toolkit that [was initially released 2011](https://github.com/atk4/atk4/commit/976ccce73c5c7bf5afbedc70aa3f72158dbf534b#diff-8e1db8ebf3425c345973e98193903012). Other projects are often using different "concept" and would not work optimally if we add "DataSet" and "Action" implementation.

### Q: When can I use Agile Data in my project?

Summer 2016.

You will find our road-map as well as recent updates at the bottom of this page. There are already a stable build of the framemwork which you can try, but some features are missing.

### Q: How can I contribute to this Open-Source framework?

First, Go [to our chat room](https://gitter.im/atk4/dataset?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge) to introduce yourself and tell us what you are willing to do to help.
