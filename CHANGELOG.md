Maintenance release to include some of the bugfixes.

* Added: `hasMany()->addFields(['foo','bar']);` (#77)
* Fix: `addCondition('foo', ['a','b'])` no longer sets default value for field `foo` (#77)
* Fix: `addField(new Field(), 'name')` displays error to remind you to use `add(new Field(), 'name')` (#77)
* Change: traversing hasOne reference without loaded record no longer generates exception but gives you un-loaded model. (#78)
* Added: `hasOne('client_id', ['default'=>$d])` will now properly set default for `client_id` field (#78)
* Fix: When building sub-qureies, [alias is properly used](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/relations.html?highlight=alias#relation-aliases). (#78)

## 1.0.1

This is our first maintenance release that solves several important issues.

* Change: `$m->insert()` will return ID and not clone of `$m`. Cloning was causing some problems.
* Change: calling ref() on object without active record will return you object without active record instead of exception
* Change: `$m->ref()` into non-existant hasOne() relation then [saving it will update field inside $m](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/relations.html?highlight=contact_id#relations-with-new-records).
* Added ability to call `save([$data])`, which will combine set() and save()
* Added [support for `$model->title_field`](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/model.html#title-field-and-id-field)
* added [$m->isDirty()](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/model.html#Model::isDirty)
* Added [afterUnload and beforeUnload hooks](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/model.html#hooks).
* Added support for [automated model reloading](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/expressions.html?highlight=reloading#model-reloading-after-save)
* Added support for advanced patterns described here:
* ability to implement [soft-delete](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/advanced.html#soft-delete), [audit](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/advanced.html#audit-fields)
* support to [override default method actions](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/model.html?highlight=hook#how-to-prevent-action), e.g. [delete()](shttp://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/advanced.html#soft-delete-that-overrides-default-delete)
* support to [verify updates](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/model.html?highlight=hook#how-to-verify-updates) with afterInsertQuery
* ability to create [fields with unique values](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/advanced.html#creating-unique-field)
* Added support for [Related Aliases](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/relations.html#relation-aliases). Now you can hasOne() hasMany() to itself.
* Fix: when you update field from join and then immediatelly save()
* Fix: when you join on existing field
* Fix: update and delete no longer try to use join or aliases
* Fix: setting different values twice wouldn't reset dirty status if you return to the original
* Fix: dirty flags are still available for `afterSave()` method (so that you know which fields were saved)
* Documented $m->withID();
* Updated to latest version of DSQL
