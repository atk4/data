**Merged pull requests:**

- fix \#326 [\#327](https://github.com/atk4/data/pull/327) ([romaninsh](https://github.com/romaninsh))

## 1.3.6

This release adds some great improvements to the aggregate fields. The most notable change is that
you no longer need to specify 'field' for 'count' aggregation, it has been a thorn:

``` php
$this->hasMany('Invoices', new Invoice())->addField('invoice_count', ['aggregate'=>'count']);
```

Now the alternative syntax is available, where you can just define your expression explicitly:

```
$this->hasMany('Items', new Item())->addField('list', ['expr'=>'group_concat([name] separator "+")']);
```

**Closed issues:**

- Documentation atk4/data not meet atk/data-primer repository [\#328](https://github.com/atk4/data/issues/328)

**Merged pull requests:**

- fix doc typo [\#332](https://github.com/atk4/data/pull/332) ([DarkSide666](https://github.com/DarkSide666))
- remove method guessFieldType - it was disabled for some time now [\#331](https://github.com/atk4/data/pull/331) ([romaninsh](https://github.com/romaninsh))
- Significantly improve flexibility of aggregates [\#330](https://github.com/atk4/data/pull/330) ([romaninsh](https://github.com/romaninsh))

## 1.3.7

Minor release. Calling `addCondition('age', '>', 30)` will no longer mark field `age` as system.

# 1.2.0

When upgrading to 1.2.x branch watch out if your "Model" has a validate() method. The
database connection will now use "utf8" so if you used non-utf8 before you might need
to convert chartsets.

 - Added support for validate() in your Models
 - Added support for classic DSN format (mysql://..)
 - Added support for single-table Array Persistence
 - Using charset=utf8 connection by default

## 1.2.1

IMPORTANT: Agile Data will on longer prefix model class with `Model_` is specified as string:

``` php
$this->hasOne('client_id', 'Client'); // refers to Client, not Model_Client
```

For more info see #244

- Now support Agile Core 1.3.0 #240
- Migrate to CodeCov and improve coverage #241 #242
- Improved [documentation for $mandatory and $required](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/fields.html#Field::$mandatory) #233
- Added [documentation for Hooks](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/hooks.html) #238
- Fix Persistence_Array usage without table #245 #246

## 1.2.2

Agile Data was created some time ago, before factory() implementation was completed in Agile Core. At
that time we had to make a decision how to better set the default class for the field, so we used
propreties such as `_default_class_addField`. Now that Agile Core allows us to specify `Seed`, we
have refactored some of that internal functionality to rely on factory(). This should not impact
your applications unless you are using custom persistence. #261

Additional fixes:

- Persistence to hold Model Prefix #152
- adding addTitle() now hides 'id' field #252 #253
- refLink() to pass $defaults #254
- couldn't connect to sqlite due to ;charset postfix in DSN #256 #257
- improve iterating models without id field #260


## 1.2.3

This version focuses on enabling you to define your own Field classes, such as more advanced Password
handling field. See example: https://github.com/atk4/login/blob/master/src/Field/Password.php

Introduced new way to verify field values with `$model->compare('age', 20);` which returs boolean. Also
in addition to `enum` property, you can use `values` property with a field now.

Rewrote Overview section of documentation and added new information on Fields and Static Persistence.

 - Added `Persistence_Static` #265
 - Implemented `$field->values` property #266
 - Added `Field->compare()` and `Model->compare()`
 - Improved support for user-defined fields (nee `Field\Password` from https://github.com/atk4/login) #259
 - Allow to specify join kind
 - Allow fields extended from `Field` class to be loaded from SQL #269
 - Started official support of 7.2.
 - Fixed typecasting when using Array persistence
 - Extra docs on: Fields, Static Persistence
 - Docs rewrite of Overiew section.

# 1.0

This is our first stable version release for Agile Data. The class and
method structure has sufficiently matured and will not be changed much
anymore. Further 1.0.x versions will be focused on increasing stability
and bugfixes. Versions 1.x will add more notable features, but if any
incompatibilities will occur, then they will be mentioned in release
notes and CHAGELOG.md

* Rewrote QuickStart guide and README.md, so everyone should re-read them
* added Model::setLimit, setOrder
* added Model::export([])
* added Model iterator
* added Model::each
* added concise var_dump() support for most objects
* added Model::getRef() and Model::getRefs()
* added Field_SQL_One::addFields() and addTitle()
* added support for nested joins in model
* added Model::withID
* added Model::loadAny()
* added Model::loadBy() and tryLoadBy()
* added Model::rawIterator()
* field consistency improvement in action('select') and action('fx')
* Model::ref() added 2nd argument as model defaults
* defaults with value of NULL are ignored
* improved coding style with StyleCI

## 1.0.2

Maintenance release to include some of the bugfixes.

* Change: classes `Field_One`, `Field_Many` and `Field_SQL_One` are renamed to `Relation_One`, `Relation_Many` and `Relation_SQL_One` respectively. (old classes will remain for compatibility until 1.2) #86
* Added: `hasMany()->addFields(['foo','bar']);` (#77)
* Fix: `addCondition('foo', ['a','b'])` no longer sets default value for field `foo` (#77)
* Fix: `addField(new Field(), 'name')` displays error to remind you to use `add(new Field(), 'name')` (#77)
* Change: traversing hasOne reference without loaded record no longer generates exception but gives you un-loaded model. (#78)
* Added: `hasOne('client_id', ['default'=>$d])` will now properly set default for `client_id` field (#78)
* Fix: When building sub-qureies, [alias is properly used](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/relations.html?highlight=alias#relation-aliases). (#78)

* Added support for [automated model reloading](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/expressions.html?highlight=reloading#model-reloading-after-save)
* Added support for advanced patterns described here:
* ability to implement [soft-delete](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/advanced.html#soft-delete), [audit](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/advanced.html#audit-fields)
* support to [override default method actions](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/model.html?highlight=hook#how-to-prevent-action), e.g. [delete()](shttp://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/advanced.html#soft-delete-that-overrides-default-delete)
* support to [verify updates](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/model.html?highlight=hook#how-to-verify-updates) with afterInsertQuery

* Added support for [Related Aliases](http://agile-data.readthedocs.io/en/develop/relations.html#relation-aliases). Now you can hasOne() hasMany() to itself.
* Fix: when you update field from join and then immediatelly save()
* Fix: when you join on existing field
* Fix: update and delete no longer try to use join or aliases
* Fix: setting different values twice wouldn't reset dirty status if you return to the original
* Fix: dirty flags are still available for `afterSave()` method (so that you know which fields were saved)
